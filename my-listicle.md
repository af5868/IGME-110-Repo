# Roblox Games That Aren't Slop By Genre


## Combat
1. [**YBA**](https://www.roblox.com/games/2809202155/Your-Bizarre-Adventure)
   - YBA is a combat-story game based off of Jojo's Bizzare Adventure. This game has amazing character building, skill trees, level systems, gamemodes, skins, and so much more. There are hundreds of different builds you can make, which is part of what makes this game so enjoyable. YBA is modeled beautifully and arguably one of the best roblox games of all time in its prime. Unfortunately, after the developer handed his ownership off to another developer, it fell off hard. 

2. [**Armored Patrol**](https://www.roblox.com/games/1340132428/Armored-Patrol-v9-5)
   - This is a vehicle-based battle simulator with a lot to it. This is an older game originating from 2008! Very fun, capture the point style gameplay. Unfortunately, the game has been stolen by old developers on a campaign to eliminate the original!!! The [copy](https://www.roblox.com/games/10518166490/ARMORED-PATROL) has more active players than the [original](https://www.roblox.com/games/1340132428/Armored-Patrol-v9-5)... what a shame.
     
4. [**PHIGHTING**](https://www.roblox.com/games/7138009149/PHIGHTING-ALPHA)
   - Phighting is a unique third person shooter with 15 different classes and 25 different maps. All the characters are themed off of classic roblox items. Fun gameplay with enjoyable characters and music.
     
## Horror
 1. [**DOORS**](https://www.roblox.com/games/6516141723/DOORS)
    - Of course, DOORS is one of the most influential games to hit roblox. After its release, it created a whole subgenre of horror games based off of it (because of how unoriginal roblox game developers are). Very well-made game, great soundtrack, incredibly influential. Must-play game.

2. [**Anomaly Watch**](https://www.roblox.com/games/15694887572/CHURCH-Anomaly-Watch)
    - Anomaly watch is a fun horror game inspired by Mandela Catalogue and the I'm On Observation Duty games. Fun with friends and is a refresher from all the repetitivity of modern roblox games.

3. [**Forsaken**](https://www.roblox.com/games/18687417158/Forsaken)
    - Yes, I'm adding Forsaken. Despite the stigma, Forsaken is a very enjoyable killer vs survivors game with tons of replayability. Very balanced with a high skill ceiling. Definitely the best roblox game of all time in terms of music composition aswell. 100% give it a try. Now, enough glazing. The standard for roblox horror games have become so unoriginal. "Good" horror games on roblox are either a Dead By Daylight clone or a Doors clone. Forsaken is very obviously a close copy of DBD. Despite that, it has it's differences and is worth a play. However, roblox developers are some of the most unoriginal developers on the Earth.

4. [**Dandy's World**](https://www.roblox.com/games/16116270224/Dandys-World-ALPHA)
    - Controversial take: Dandy's World is a good game. Despite being aimed towards younger children, this game has an INSANELY high skill ceiling. In Dandy's, there are 34 different character with all different unique stats and abilities as well as character building with trinkets. Its an infinite floor survival game with a max of 8 players. Unfortunately, also somewhattt a DBD clone with machines that have to be completed before advancing to lower floors. There are AI versions of the playable characters that will try and kill you. The further you go, the harder it gets. A LOT harder. Very fun game but unfortunately lacks a lot of replayability.  

## Misc

1. [Creature CHAOS](https://www.roblox.com/games/10785055221/Creature-CHAOS)
    - This game has a lot of backstory to it. Initially, this game was called "Creeper CHAOS", which was a massive game created by a relatively famous roblox dev, until roblox eventually took it down for copyright reasons from Minecraft. After that, the game was gone for a few years. Many clones of the game released which quickly took its place. Though, not as successful. Eventually, the original developer remade the game under the name "Creature CHAOS". However, at that point, there had already been a plethora of clones of the original game. The developer went out of there way to go through numerous clones and take down as many as possible, but more and more kept appearing. Now, the game lays at only a few hundred players at a time meanwhile some clones have up to 1,000. Anyway! The game is about building a structure with your team to protect yourself from creatures killing you. They can destroy your base. Real players are the creatures.

1. [Plates of Fate](https://www.roblox.com/games/4783966408/Plates-of-Fate-Remastered)
   - This is a fun little game where you and a large group of players are put on individual plates and random events can happen to each plate, person, or server. Mostly luck-based, but a fun passtime. The game linked isn't actually the original as the original developer took down their game. This is a clone that totally ripped off plates of fate and did not give credit nor compensation. Notice how unoriginal developers are the main reason roblox is a bad place to make games now.

3. [Build A Boat For Treasure](https://www.roblox.com/games/537413528/Build-A-Boat-For-Treasure)
   - This game is all about building your own creations with limited materials. You're supposed to create a boat, sail to get trasure to buy more materials to build bigger boats. However, in the past probably 7 years, the updates have been more mechanics-based so you're able to build lots of cooler things than boats. Good game, slow at first but picks up.




















By the way, while writing this project, I had spent about 30 minutes on writing when i swiped left on my touchpad. Windows thought it'd be a really cool feature to make a small swipe on your touchpad to be a shortcut for the google back arrow. It completely erased all my writing and is unrecoverable so I have to restart over. I tried doing it again, and it gave me a pop-up "are you sure you want to go back? you have unsaved data." But it didn't give me this pop-up the time I accidentally swiped left and deleted half an hour worth of progress on this assignment. Out of my frustration, I was typing a very upset paragraph about what happened when I did it again. This is my second time writing this paragraph. God bless windows for this amazing shortcut.
