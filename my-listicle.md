# Roblox Games That Aren't Slop By Genre


## Combat


## Horror
 1. (**DOORS**)[https://www.roblox.com/games/6516141723/DOORS]
- Of course, DOORS is one of the most influential games to hit roblox. After its release, it created a whole subgenre of horror games based off of it (because of how unoriginal roblox game developers are). Very well-made game, great soundtrack, incredibly influential. Must-play game.

2. (**Anomaly Watch**)[https://www.roblox.com/games/15694887572/CHURCH-Anomaly-Watch]
- Anomaly watch is a fun horror game inspired by Mandela Catalogue and the I'm On Observation Duty games. Fun with friends and is a refresher from all the repetitivity of modern roblox games.

3. (**Forsaken**)[https://www.roblox.com/games/18687417158/Forsaken]
- Yes, I'm adding Forsaken. Despite the stigma, Forsaken is a very enjoyable killer vs survivors game with tons of replayability. Very balanced with a high skill ceiling. Definitely the best roblox game of all time in terms of music composition aswell. 100% give it a try. Now, enough glazing. The standard for roblox horror games have become so unoriginal. "Good" horror games on roblox are either a Dead By Daylight clone or a Doors clone. Forsaken is very obviously a close copy of DBD. Despite that, it has it's differences and is worth a play. However, roblox developers are some of the most unoriginal developers on the Earth.

4. (**Dandy's World**)[https://www.roblox.com/games/16116270224/Dandys-World-ALPHA]
- Controversial take: Dandy's World is a good game. Despite being aimed towards younger children, this game has an INSANELY high skill ceiling. In Dandy's, there are 34 different character with all different unique stats and abilities as well as character building with trinkets. Its an infinite floor survival game with a max of 8 players. Unfortunately, also somewhattt a DBD clone with machines that have to be completed before advancing to lower floors. There are AI versions of the playable characters that will try and kill you. The further you go, the harder it gets. A LOT harder. Very fun game but unfortunately lacks a lot of replayability.

By the way, while writing this project, I had spent about 30 minutes on writing when i swiped left on my touchpad. Windows thought it'd be a really cool feature to make a small swipe on your touchpad to be a shortcut for the google back arrow. It completely erased all my writing and is unrecoverable so I have to restart over. I tried doing it again, and it gave me a pop-up "are you sure you want to go back? you have unsaved data." But it didn't give me this pop-up the time I accidentally swiped left and deleted half an hour worth of progress on this assignment. Out of my frustration, I was typing a very upset paragraph about what happened when I did it again. This is my second time writing this paragraph. God bless windows for this amazing shortcut.
